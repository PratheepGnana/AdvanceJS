# **What is `9007199254740991` in JavaScript?**

In JavaScript, **`9007199254740991`** is a very special number:

## **It is `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`**

JavaScript uses **IEEE‑754 double‑precision floating‑point** numbers for all numeric values.  
This format can only represent integers **exactly** up to a certain limit.

That limit is:

```
Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER === 9007199254740991

```

This means:

-   It is the **largest integer** JavaScript can represent _without losing precision_.
-   Any integer **greater than this** cannot be represented reliably using the `Number` type.
-   Operations beyond this limit may produce incorrect or surprising results.

----------

# **Why this limit exists**

JavaScript numbers have **53 bits** of precision for the integer portion.

The maximum safe integer is:

[ 2^{53} - 1 = 9007199254740991 ]

Beyond this, JavaScript cannot distinguish between consecutive integers.

Example:

```js
9007199254740992 + 1 === 9007199254740992  // true (incorrect!)

```

----------

# **How to work with bigger integers**

Use **BigInt**, introduced in modern JavaScript:

```js
const big = 9007199254740991n + 1n;
console.log(big); // 9007199254740992n

```

BigInt allows you to safely handle arbitrarily large integers.
